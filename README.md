# Centrality Metrics based on OSM networks
This is a working progress of centrality metrics calculated from OSM data.
It is based primarily on Qgis, GDAL and GRASS algorithms organized on a series of processing models.
Later on, some other libraries and languagjes will be included.
There is a metric on each folder. First one is Degree of Centrality
Each metrics has its code, some example.
Gradually I will upload the data and other things relevant.
